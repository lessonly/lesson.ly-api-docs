# Introduction

Welcome to the Lessonly API documentation! First you will need to get an API key by signing into your account, navigating to the company settings page and clicking "API & Webhook".

Currently we only have language bindings for shell, however we are open to providing libraries in other languages. Contact us at [info@lessonly.com] (mailto:info@lessonly.com) to let us know what libraries you would like to see.
