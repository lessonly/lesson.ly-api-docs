# Introduction

Welcome to the Lessonly API documentation! First you will need to get an API key by signing into your account, navigating to the company settings page and clicking "Show API credentials".

Currently we only have language bindings for shell, however we are open to providing libraries in other libraries.  Contact us to let us know what libraries you would like to see to connect with Lessonly:  [here] (mailto:info@lessonly.com).
